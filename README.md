# Test task for rasu.ru
https://rasu.ru/

## Timeline

I applied for a job position at the end of December.

They sent me a test task and asked me to ping them after the new year holidays (around 9â€“10 of January).

I deployed the test task and sent them a link to a live demo and a link to the source code via email.

I got no response.

I was asked for feedback, and I answered that I had already sent it.

They checked a spam folder and found it;

I asked for feedback a few times (after January 9);

They told me that there will be a call in a few days (but haven't specified time and date);

I asked again;

Same answer;

I asked again in a few days;

They told me that a certain employee would contact me.

I was never contacted, so the next day I asked again.

I was told that the position was closed and that I had never responded to their emails.

I checked the emails but couldn't find them. My email provider is sometimes banned by corporate policies. But in my CV, I provided 3 ways to contact me; they only used one, never got a response, and never tried to use another way to contact me.
